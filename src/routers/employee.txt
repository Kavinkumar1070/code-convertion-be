## API Endpoint Analysis:

Here's the analysis of the provided code from `employee.py`:

**1.  `/employee/employees/reademployee` Endpoint**

* **Prefix**: `/employee`
* **Function Name**: `read_employee`
* **Roles**: `employee`, `teamlead`
* **URL/Endpoint**: `/employees/reademployee`
* **HTTP Method**: `GET`
* **Path Parameters**: `None`
* **Class Parameters**: `None` 

**Explanation:**

This endpoint retrieves employee details based on the currently logged-in employee.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Authorization:** Access is restricted to employees and team leads through the `roles_required` decorator. 
* **Functionality:**
    * The `read_employee` function first obtains the current employee's ID and role from the `get_current_employee` and `get_current_employee_roles` dependencies.
    * It then fetches the employee details using the `get_all_employee_employment_details` function from the `crud.employee` module.
    * The function handles both scenarios:
        * If the current employee is an `employee`, it retrieves details for their own ID.
        * If the current employee is a `teamlead`, it retrieves details for their own ID.
    * If no employee is found, a 404 error is raised.
    * The response is a dictionary containing various employee details like `employee_email`, `job_position`, `department`, etc.
