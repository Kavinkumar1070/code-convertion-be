The provided code from constants.py is a collection of constants used in a Python application. There are no functions, classes, or API routes defined in this code. Therefore, there are no details to capture for functions, classes, or API routes.

The code defines various constants related to different services and configurations, such as:

* Google OAuth: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens): `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `COOKIE_AUTHORIZATION_NAME`, `COOKIE_DOMAIN`
* Spotify: `SPOTIFY_TOKEN_URL`, `SPOTIFY_USER_URL`, `GRANT_TYPE`, `REDIRECT_URI`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
* Nemo Backend: `NEMO_BACKEND_URL`

These constants are likely used in other parts of the application to configure and interact with these services.

Since there are no functions, classes, or API routes defined, there is no need to capture details for them.
